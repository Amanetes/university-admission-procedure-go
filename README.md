This is the *University Admission Procedure (Go)* project I made myself.


<p>It takes a lot of hard work to enroll in the university of your dreams. Although, we tend to dismiss how difficult it is for the university to handle the document volume. In this project, you'll deal with university applicants. You'll implement an algorithm to determine which applicants are going to be enrolled. At each stage, the algorithm will gradually become more complex and comprehensive!</p>
